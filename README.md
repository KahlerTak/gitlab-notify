# Gitlab Notify
## Stay Informed in Real Time
GitLab Notifier keeps you updated with important events across your GitLab projects â€” directly in your browser.

Whenever a merge request you're involved in receives updates or requires your attention, the extension sends you a native push notification. No more missed reviews, comments, or approvals.

Key features:

ðŸ”„ Real-time GitLab API integration

ðŸ“¬ Notifications for updated merge requests that need your input

ðŸ§© Works seamlessly with self-managed or hosted GitLab instances

ðŸ“ˆ Future updates will include additional notification types for issues, pipelines, and more

Perfect for developers and teams who want to stay on top of their GitLab activity â€” without constantly switching tabs.

## What can it do?

The plugin checks for updates in Gitlab Merge Requests where the user is assigned as a reviewer, whose private token is 
configured in the plugin. It will send desktop Notifications, when there was a new commit.

## What is planned?

* Add configuration for different notification types
* Add support for comment updates in the merge request for new notifications
* Add support for re-requesting reviews 
* Add support for review requests assigned to the user and notify that user if any update was made to the merge request
* Add live statistics about current merge requests and their status
