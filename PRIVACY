Last updated: 30.03.2025

GitLab Notifier is a browser extension designed to notify users about relevant events in their GitLab projects, such as merge request updates requiring attention.

1. What Data We Collect
GitLab Notifier does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.

The extension accesses data from the GitLab API solely to display notifications relevant to you. This includes:

Merge request metadata (e.g. title, state, assigned reviewers)

Basic user-related information from your GitLab account (used locally only)

All API calls are made directly from your browser to your GitLab instance (self-hosted or gitlab.com).
We do not track your activity, store logs, or use analytics.

2. Permissions
The extension requests permission to:

Connect to the GitLab API

Display desktop notifications

Optionally store your GitLab API token locally in your browser’s extension storage

All data is stored locally and never leaves your device.

3. Third Parties
We do not share data with any third parties. No tracking scripts, no external analytics, no ad networks.

4. Your Control
You may revoke the extension’s permissions at any time via your browser settings.
You may also remove your stored GitLab token via the extension’s options page.
